What is this?

LICW's customized version of SG Phillip's https://morsecode.world/international/trainer/generator.html (and by the way, please note that his original text-to-sound is handled by .js libraries available here: https://github.com/scp93ch/morse-pro)

If you just want to use it: https://longislandcw.github.io/morsebrowser/index.html

Or download https://longislandcw.github.io/morsebrowser/download/morse.zip and unzip, then open index.html in your browser.

Feel free to make feature requests or bug reports using the "Issues" tab.

KN4YRM originally built it to be "ham tinkerer-friendly." This means it isn't built with the latest-and-greatest software development tools and techniques, but rather some compromises were made so the code might be approachable to a non-professional audience of hams who might want to tinker with it. For example, frameworks with steep learning curves might be easy for KN4YRM to work with, but hard for a non-professional software programmer to pickup. So for example, instead of react.js or angular.js, a beginner-friendly knockout.js was selected. Currently, it can best be described as knockout.js with bootstrap styling, with webpack used for builds (sourcemaps enabled so tinkerers can see how it works). This decision was also made so that ongoing future maintenance and feature requests aren't dependent on one person. KN4YRM suggests over time not losing sight of this philospohy for this project. Hams are encouraged to tinker with it and make pull requests.
