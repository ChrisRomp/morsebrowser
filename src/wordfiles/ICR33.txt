knowledge is power
a different kettle of fish
a good beginning makes a good ending
a little knowledge is a dangerous thing
a millstone around ones neck
absent minded professor
accidents will happen
an albatross around ones neck
as fast as greased lightning
build a better mousetrap
carbon footprint
charm offensive
climb on the bandwagon
crocodile tears
curiosity killed the cat
delusions of grandeur
dollars to doughnuts
dont change horses in midstream
dont throw the baby out with the bathwater
everybody out
the exception to the rule
faith will move mountains
fellow traveller
forbidden fruit
good samaritan
graveyard shift
greased lightning
harbinger of doom
heard it through the grapevine
household words
imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
in the limelight
jump on the bandwagon
living daylights
mint condition
moving the goalposts
necessity is the mother of invention
nothing ventured, nothing gained
on the shoulders of giants
preaching to the choir
raspberry tart
the road less travelled
say goodnight gracie
shrinking violet
standing on the shoulders of giants
the living daylights
zero tolerance

the scorching sun
get something out of your system
wrap your head around something
comparing apples to oranges
do something at the drop of a hat
ignorance is bliss
put something on ice
a little learning is a dangerous thing
get wind of something
doubt is the beginning of wisdom
good fences make good neighbors
he who hesitates is lost
hindsight is always 20/20
laugh before breakfast
life is too short not to do something that matters
lightning never strikes twice in the same place
no friends but the mountains
seeing is believing
sometimes we are the student
the end justifies the means
there is an exception to every rule
those who know many languages
to travel hopefully is better
why keep a dog and bark yourself?
work expands to fill the time available
zeal without knowledge is fire without light
any publicity is good publicity
ask no questions and hear no lies
