a fly in the ointment
a fools paradise
a journey of a thousand miles
a legend in ones own lifetime
a penny for your thoughts
a picture is worth a thousand words
a skeleton in the closet
a wolf in sheeps clothing
a word in edgeways
achilles heel
agree to disagree
all intents and purposes
all that glitters is not gold
an accident waiting to happen
as soon as possible
as cool as a cucumber
as dead as a doornail
as straight as a die
ask a silly question and youll get a silly answer
ballpark figure
beauty is in the eye of the beholder
beg the question
bells and whistles
binge drinking
birds of a feather flock together
brand spanking new
bread always falls buttered side down
burning the midnight oil
chickens come home to roost
chip on your shoulder
close quarters
club sandwich
grasping at straws
cold shoulder
complete shambles
cool as a cucumber
dont count your chickens before they hatch
counting sheep
crackpot
the customer is always right
devils advocate
dont count your chickens before they are hatched
double standard
dropping like flies
elephant in the room
elvis has left the building
emperors new clothes
the face that launched a thousand ships
failing to plan is planning to fail
fair to middling
fend for yourself
fiddling while rome burns
fly in the ointment
for all intents and purposes
from strength to strength
get a word in edgeways
get underway
good riddance
goody, goody gumdrops
grinning like a cheshire cat
higgledy piggledy
horse feathers
straight from the horses mouth
houston, we have a problem
identity theft
if i had my druthers
in a quandary
in a nutshell
in stitches
in the doghouse
in the doldrums
innocent until proven guilty
jam tomorrow
kangaroo court
keep your distance
the whole kit and caboodle
knee jerk reaction
know which side your bread is buttered
laughing stock
legend in ones own lifetime
let sleeping dogs lie
living on borrowed time
meet your waterloo
the pen is mightier than the sword
mouth watering
nautical phrases
no laughing matter
one good turn deserves another
penny pinching
primrose path
punching above your weight
push the envelope
put on your thinking cap
put your shoulder to the wheel
run the gauntlet
scraping the barrel
security blanket
skeleton in the closet
he smallest room in the house
space, the final frontier
spelling bee
spitting image
spring forward, fall back
stinking rich
straight as a die
survival of the fittest
the chickens come home to roost
the elephant in the room
the emperors new clothes
the fly in the ointment
the smallest room in the house
the usual suspects
thinking cap
tomorrow is another day
total shambles
tower of strength
truth is stranger than fiction
tuckered out
whet your appetite
white elephant
wolf in sheeps clothing
do not know anything about
of health and human services
have anything to do with
hundreds of millions of dollars
the new york stock exchange
increase in the number of
an integral part of the
i can’t complain
i couldn’t agree more
i am starving
a blessing in disguise
cut somebody some slack
get your act together
pull someones leg
pull yourself together
get a taste of your own medicine
give someone the cold shoulder
play devils advocate
rain on someones parade
a snowball effect
leave no stone unturned
business before pleasure
everyone has their price
flattery will get you nowhere
if you want a thing done well, do it yourself
my favorite song
laughter is the best medicine
learn a language
memory is the treasure of the mind
never put off until tomorrow
patience is a virtue
practice makes perfect
practice what you preach
the age of miracles is past
the comeback is greater than the setback
there are two sides to every question
to learn a language
tomorrow never comes
truth is valuable
two is company, but three is a crowd
unity is strength
what does not kill me makes me stronger
whatever floats your boat
worrying never did anyone any good
you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs
separate the wheat from the chaff
a friend to everyone
a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
a new language is a new life
absolute power
ask a silly question
