15 minutes of fame
center of gravity
keep your friends close
knuckle under
fortune favours the bold
pecking order
a leopard cannot change its spots
picture perfect
vicious circle
barking up the wrong tree
the weakest link
think outside the box
pleased as punch
live long and prosper
a watched pot never boils
near the knuckle
its not rocket science
birds of a feather
batten down the hatches
cotton picking
pig and whistle
go over like a lead balloon
the proof of the pudding
blue plate special
another day, another dollar
feeding frenzy
read between the lines
a feather in your cap
cat got your tongue?
finders keepers
poetic justice
hes sitting on the fence
lickety split
green eyed monster
morning person
dressed to the nines
had nothing to do with
latin phrases
monday morning papers didnt come
very much for joining us
a chain is only as strong as its weakest link
take care of the pennies
gussied up
diamond in the rough
movers and shakers
the best defense is a good offense
not rocket science
nothing to do with the
empty vessels make the most noise
parting shot
barking dogs never bite
i do not believe that
anchors aweigh
theres a method to his madness
whole hearted
the purpose of this study
what a palaver
the devil is in the details
bury the hatchet
put your best foot forward
against the grain
my way or the highway
the results of this study
keep up with the joneses
jack of all trades, master of none
the rest of the country
16 candles
theres method to my madness
misery loves company
senior citizen
start from scratch
has the cat got your tongue?
burn bridges
be still, my beating heart
raining cats and dogs
the tail wagging the dog
blood is thicker than water
a house divided against itself cannot stand
walnuts and pears you plant for your heirs
happily ever after
the longest day must have an end
toe curling
tell me who your friends are
if you cant stand the heat, get out of the kitchen
the best laid schemes of mice and men
country bumpkin
a perfect storm
a thing of beauty is a joy forever
penny wise and pound foolish
silence is golden
method in my madness
money demands care
heavens to betsy
other times other manners
its raining cats and dogs
not playing with a full deck
let bygones be bygones
thank you for joining us
weather the storm
i do not know whether
up the creek without a paddle
riding shotgun
wet blanket
the proof of the pudding is in the eating
as thick as thieves
let someone off the hook
money phrases
there are clouds on the horizon
up a creek without a paddle
what are you talking about
live to fight another day
if at first you dont succeed
one giant leap for mankind
take potluck
be afraid, be very afraid
im growing up
the heebie jeebies
whipper snapper
i thought it was a
sitting pretty
a watched man never plays
putting the cart before the horse
smoke and mirrors
hope springs eternal
once bitten, twice shy
honesty is the best policy
on the warpath
alive and kicking
an army marches on its stomach
all systems go
the turn of the century
a diamond in the rough
it is a poor workman who blames his tools
make good friends
hearts content
the squeaky wheel
siamese twins
quantum leap
what goes around, comes around
absence makes the heart grow fonder
pulling ones leg
tempest in a teapot
go back to the drawing board
carte blanche
it is better to give than to receive
red herring
those who do not learn from history
in the history of the
like riding a bicycle
to be worn out is to be renewed
rough diamond
a ship in a harbour is safe
mother country
too little, too late
the darkest hour is just before the dawn
wonders will never cease
knuckle down
there is no time like the present
i do not believe it
like father, like son
it takes a village
knight in shining armor
as pleased as punch
cold comfort
a knight in shining armour
bean counter
tempest in a teacup
a picture is worth 1000 words
the balance of power
it cost me a fortune
quality time
it goes without saying
from sea to shining sea
harvest moon
to err is human, to forgive divine
helter skelter
no brainer
between a rock and a hard place
tickle the ivories
glass ceiling
blow your own trumpet
history repeats itself
whistle blower
stand and deliver
hit the ground running
united we stand, divided we fall
the writing is on the wall
the longest journey starts with a single step
a rolling stone gathers no moss
lose your marbles
the balance of trade
hot blooded
between you, me and the bed post
pennies from heaven
the best defence is a good offence
fingers and thumbs
back to the drawing board
variety is the spice of life
under the weather
cutting corners
another think coming
monkeys like peanuts
bad news travels fast
you scratch my back and i will scratch yours
he who laughs last laughs loudest
i do not think anybody
honey catches more flies than vinegar
one of the reasons why
60 seconds
a diamond is forever
hush puppies
know which way the wind is blowing
the more the merrier
the darkest hour is just before dawn
over egg the pudding
channel surfing
many happy returns
what cannot be cured must be endured
go back to the drawing board
through thick and thin
darkest before the dawn
star crossed lovers
if you cant live longer, live deeper
beat a hasty retreat
throw caution to the wind
cut off without a penny
all fingers and thumbs
the early bird catches the worm
without a shadow of a doubt
send packing
steal my thunder
one of the most popular
there is safety in numbers
half hearted
go haywire
if you cant be good, be careful
respect is not given, it is earned
there is no shame in not knowing
have nothing to do with
the grass is always greener
the whole shebang
its better to give than to receive
shiny are the distant hills
body surfing
in the context of the
tickle the ivories
murphys law
baptism of fire
absent without leave
a bad workman blames his tools
tickled pink
to make matters worse
four corners of the earth
hard hearted
the streets are paved with gold
cut the mustard
a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse
game of thrones
plugged nickel
the squeaky wheel gets the grease
i need more cowbell
diamond in the rough
charley horse
the darkest hour
level playing field
trouble and strife
you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
actions speak louder than words
cat burglar
much ado about nothing
im stumped
you cannot make bricks without straw
in the catbird seat
against the clock
you have another think coming
purpose of this study was
charity begins at home
every picture tells a story
three strikes and you are out
faint hearted
keep the ball rolling
neither here nor there
phrases that people get wrong
has nothing to do with
give someone the benefit of the doubt
odds bodkins
a no brainer
have an inkling
all present and correct
for good measure
so much for joining us
give no quarter
rest on your laurels
absence makes the heart grow fonder
april showers bring may flowers
