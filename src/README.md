What should go in each folder?

assets/ Images etc.

morse-pro/ SG Phillips library. From time-to-time this should probably be merged if he makes updates.

wordfiles/ the .json and .txt files that comprise "lessons"

wordfilesconfigs/ the wordlists.json file that drives the lesson navigation to a lesson file in wordfiles/  Currently this is 1 file. If it grows larger might make sense to normalize it into several files...
